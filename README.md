# Static Comp Challenge - Garden Helper webpage

### Abstract:
This project focused on recreating a static webpage comp using only HTML and CSS. The only requirement was to respect the integrity of the comp's overall design. Beyond that, creative license was given for the theme, text, color palette, image, and font choices. As a hobby gardener, I chose to create a "Garden Helper" webpage that serves as a one-stop resource for all the information a user would need to plan their garden.
